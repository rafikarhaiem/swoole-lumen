1- Copy those files under your laravel project
3- Make sure to run these commands for your project in local before building the dockefile:
composer require swooletw/laravel-swoole
Edit bootstrap/app.php
$app->register(SwooleTW\Http\LumenServiceProvider::class);
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-swoole
chown -R www-data:www-data /path-of-your-laravel-project
chmod -R 777 storage/
chmod -R 777 ./
4- docker-compose build
5- docker-compose up -d
6- docker-compose exec app bash
7- php artisan swoole:http start
8- php artisan migrate
9- to see your database exit the app container and go to db container: 
exit
docker-compose exec db bash
10- connect to mysql:
mysql -u root -p
(the password here is laravel and the databse name is laravel also , you can change them in docker-compose file and .env file)
11- see if the database created or no:
show databses;
